# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
The famous Rock-Paper-Scissors Game now as electron app!

## How to run

    - ``npm install`` (to download the node_modules)
    - ``npm electron .`` (to start the app)
 
## Game rules
You already know them by heart I guess ;)

## Collaboration
- Open the project in VSCode/IntelliJ/WebStorm (or whatever you prefer) to explore the code
- Collaborate with me and create a PR with some awesome new features, UI improvements or bug-fixes ;)

## Ideas for new features and improvements
- Add a feature to change the opponent:
  - Player1 vs Computer (OK)
  - Player1 vs Player2 (Pending)
  - Computer1 vs Computer2 (Pending)
- Make the UI more awesome
- Customise the default electron menus
- Create a proper app icon for the game
- Create single distribution files for macOS, Win and Linux
